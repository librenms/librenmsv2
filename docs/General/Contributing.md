Contributing
------------

LibreNMS is a fully OpenSource network monitoring system, for it to succeed it relies on contributions. For the WebUI rewrite there are a few ways you can get involved and contribute - all equally as important.

 - Documentation. With the original fork documentation has always been written after it's needed. We'd like to ensure have excellent documentation for the rewrite.

 - Design. All of the original LibreNMS devs aren't designers by trade, we get by and with the help of the AdminLTE theme we hope this will be easier this time round. However if you are a front end developer then we can sorely use your help.

 - Code. The rewrite is pretty much from scratch. We aim to ensure everything from the fork is rewritten but we can re-use code that was written exclusively for LibreNMS. We have chosen the Laravel framework so if you can help structure / write the code that would be great.

 - Testing. Two sides to this, we always need people to test the latest release (develop branch) but also to write test units for our automated testing. We won't be accepting pull requests without a base test case but extending these out to cover the user journey would be ace.

 - Support. People ask questions, people need help. If you hang around our IRC channel and can help answer questions from new users or old then please do so. This also could involve code review and assisting with issues on GitHub.


Pull requests
-------------

We happily accept pull requests :) However we won't merge unless:

 - You write any necessary docs to go with the code.

 - You write at least the base test units for automated testing. For instance if you create a new API route, a test case needs to be written to validate it works.

 - You sign the contributors agreement for the main librenms/librenms repo. Whilst this is a rewrite and we aren't using code from the fork we still need to ensure that people don't contribute closed source code no matter the origin.
